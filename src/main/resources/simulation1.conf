# CS441 HW1: Cloud Datacenter Simulators
# Name:   Shyam Patel

# SIMULATION #1 :
# This simulation uses 1 datacenter with 2 brokers. The datacenter has 2 host machines, one of which
# is provided with more memory and has a higher million instructions/sec (MIPS) rating. There are 2
# brokers, one of whom has access to 3 virtual machines (VMs), while the other has access to 2 virtual
# machines with improved CPU, memory and MIPS configurations. All VMs in this simulation utilize a
# time-shared cloudlet scheduler policy, in which resources are shared among cloudlets. Each broker
# must receive 15 cloudlets each of varying lengths between 300 billion and 600 billion instructions.
