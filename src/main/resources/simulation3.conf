# CS441 HW1: Cloud Datacenter Simulators

# SIMULATION #3 :
# This simulation uses 1 datacenter with 2 brokers to implement the MapReduce framework for processing
# tasks in parallel. The datacenter has 2 host machines, one of which is provided with more memory and
# has a higher million instructions/sec (MIPS) rating. There are 2 brokers, one of whom has access to
# 3 virtual machines (VMs), while the other has access to 2 virtual machines with improved CPU, memory
# and MIPS configurations. All VMs in this simulation utilize a space-shared cloudlet scheduler policy,
# in which each cloudlet is given exclusive access to a VM until its execution completes. Each broker
# must receive 15 cloudlets each, which are clustered in the mapper phase into smaller cloudlets of
# varying lengths between 24 billion and 105 billion instructions to simulate MapReduce optimizations.
# The mapped cloudlets are assigned to the same VMs, using data locality to guide the task allocation.
# Lastly, the received cloudlets are aggregated in the reducer phase to produce the final output.
